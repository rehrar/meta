# Kovri Branding Brief

## 0. What is Kovri
Kovri is an Esperanto word that means 'to cover, veil, or wrap'.

Kovri provides users with the ability to run and access nodes that hide their geographic location and IP address. When used in conjunction with Kovri, the origin of Monero transactions is concealed to protect the privacy of the sender while mitigating network monitoring and other attacks. Under the hood, Kovri is a secure, private, untraceable C++ router implementation of the I2P anonymous network. What was once a fork of i2pd, Kovri has become a unique, actively-developed, community-driven C++ I2P implementation with many improvements, security enhancements, and new features over its predecessor.

## 1. Objectives & Goals
The goal of this brief is to provide an accurate repsentation of the project that will guide the chosen designer in rebranding the Kovri project.

Kovri does have an existing logo, but we would like it changed, as well as adding some branding guidelines for use with future documentation, print materials, and changes to the website. A simple brand package that identifies branding colors, fonts, new logo, and Kovri design guidelines is all that is needed. 

The rules are expected to be rather broad and generic, so as to allow some slight wiggle room for creativity within the community, as long as they operate within the general guidelines.

## 2. Budget & Schedules

TBD

## 3. Target Audience

Kovri primarily targets those who care about their online privacy and/or anonymity. Most of Kovri's audience currently uses (or is familiar with) both the Tor and Java I@P anonymous overlay networks. While Kovri wants to target those that are currently privacy-focused, we also want to have an approachable image for those who are intersted in privacy, but aren't sure where to get started.

To appeal to both sides, we feel that the Kovri brand should give a sophisticated and modern feel, that is still down-to-earth and approachable.

## 4. Available Materials

First and foremost, Kovri does have [an existing logo](https://github.com/monero-project/kovri/blob/master/README.md) as well as a [website](https://getkovri.org). The website colors can be changed in accordance with the new branding, but the layout is based on the [Monero website](https://getmonero.org) and should be kept for sake of continuity.

As Kovri is part of [The Monero Project](https://github.com/monero-project), the logo (which is the profile image on the provided GitHub link as well as can be seen on the website) of Monero can be used as inspiration as well. The [Monero website](https://getmonero.org) can also be browsed for an idea of look and feel to draw from.

There was a previous competition held on 99designs that can be viewed [here](https://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/create-beautiful-logo-kovri-privacy-enhancing-open-source-652257).

Some discussion regarding the Kovri logo can be seen on [this Monero Project meta issue](https://github.com/monero-project/meta/issues/80).

## 5. Overall Style
The current logo is a garlic next to the word 'Kovri'. We understand that as it curently stands, it's hard to tell that it is supposed to be a garlic. The reason for the garlic is because the type of routing that is done in the Kovri router is known as '[garlic routing](https://getmonero.org/resources/moneropedia/garlic-routing.html)'. That being said, we are not opposed to the image being something other than a garlic, as long as we remember that the primary goal of Kovri is privacy and anonymity when browsing.

As well, the colors do not have to be based off of the Monero colors. We are open to other ideas as long as they are well thought out, and there are reasons for the deviations.

We feel that the Kovri brand should have the following attributes:
1. A sophisticated and modern feel that is down-to-earth and approachable
2. Accurate to the technology's purpose and intent

We've asked the community to come up with some keywords to describe Kovri to jog creativity in the Issue given above. For convenience sake we will put some of them here.
- Privacy
- Anonymity
- Network (global network of intermediaries)
- Invisibility
- Protected

## 6. Definite "Do Not"s!
The following are a list of 'Do Not's.
- Do not use a large K for the primary focal point of the logo.
- Avoid Tor or Java I2P colors
- Nothing trite or run-of-the-mill (e.g. like bootstrap)
