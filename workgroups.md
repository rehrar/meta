# Monero Workgroups

## Introduction

Monero is a grassroots community in the truest sense of the phrase. There is no corporation behind it to fund development, and the Core Team (i.e. stewards) of the project volunteer their time for their Core duties.

Because Monero does not have a central structure in which to manage every project that comes from individuals or groups, Monero has a great strength (which can also be considered a weakness is some circumstances) of being an initiative-based project. This means that if something is not being done, and an individual or group would like it to be done, they should do it instead of wait for others to do it.

The Monero Project thrives when the community is given the freedom to work on projects that they have both passion and ability for, and is at its worst when everyone expects everyone else to get things done (often for free).

In the interest of encouraging more community initiatives, we take the time to explore what workgroups are, and how they can be successful in this document.

## What is a Workgroup?

A Monero Workgroup is defined as a grassroots initiative by an individual or group with the intent of furthering The Monero Project.

As you can see by the above definition, there aren't any hard and fast rules about how a workgroup should be run, by whom, and what goals they should achieve (as long as they help Monero in some fashion).

Monero Workgroups can take many forms. Some might be formal, with a defined leadership, bylaws, and dues, and others might be informal, with a fluid membership and loosely defined goals. Each workgroup is free to make their own goals and structures, and doesn't need anyone's permission to operate, or even exist.


An old example of a workgroup that existed in the past (it has since been disbanded) is the [Monero Economic Workgroup (MEW)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=776479.0). Feel free to read through the thread and see what their goals were, and what they accomplished (spoiler: not much).

Another example of a current workgroup in action is the [Monero Community](https://reddit.com/r/monerocommunity) workgroup. It was started for motivated individuals who wanted to improve the Monero community experience, and holds meetings every two weeks.

At time of writing, there have been talks of Support and Marketing workgroups as well.

## Resources

Due to its reliance on community-initiative, The Monero Project has decided to invest in setting up environments where grassroots projects can naturally develop, and enthusiastic individuals or groups will find the resources they need to brainstorm, manage, and launch their projects for the benefit of Monero. Each resource is open-source, and hosted on dedicated Monero servers, so all data and history is not in the hands of proprietary services or software. These resources include:

[Monero Taiga](https://taiga.getmonero.org): Taiga is an agile development web application that helps teams in every stage of the development process. You can learn more about Taiga [at their website](https://taiga.io), and more about the different tools for agile development [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8dYLbJiTUE) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XU0llRltyFM).

[Monero MatterMost](https://mattermost.getmonero.org) MatterMost is an open-source, self-hosted Slack alternative. The same bridging capabilities between IRC (and even Taiga) are available and already integrated, but we are now not limited to a backlog of 10,000 messages, and all communication is safely stored on dedicated Monero services instead of Slack.

[GitHub](https://github.com/monero-project): This is already in place and has been used for quite a while. The idea is that GitHub will be used as a place for coding development, and Taiga can be used for all forms of non-coding development.

## Tips for success in budding Workgroups

### Take advantage of the provided Monero resources. 
While the available resources are far from comprehensive, they are a good starting point with which to brainstorm and navigate development of your idea.
### Be open. 
Depending on the idea, some workgroups may face more community pushback than others. As a ridiculous example, if a graphic design workgroup started, and they started advocating to change the Monero color to pink and green, they are well within their rights to try for this, but it probably won't go over well when presented to the community.
### Be resolute. 
Just because not everyone is on board with an idea, doesn't mean the idea is bad (if it provably helps Monero). Monero is whatever we make it, so if you have a vision to make Monero great, and an idea of how to do it, keep on it. We all want the same thing, we just have different ideas of how to achieve it sometimes.
### Define goals early on. 
Having a workgroup for the sake of having one isn't very useful. Each workgroup should have a goal in mind, and should structure itself in a way that is conducive for achieving these goals.
### Learn to navigate conflict.
Wherever there is more than one person, there is more than one opinion on the best way to do things. There may be conflict between workgroups, and even within a workgroup on how best to help Monero. Just remember, we're all on the same side, and we all want the same thing. Navigating conflict with grace goes a long way in moving things forward.
### Be excited!
Monero is an amazing project. We really are trying to do some crazy stuff. Financial privacy. And we aren't' going to get there anywhere near as fast without your help. By creating or joining a workgroup, you are a small part in the biggest financial revolution of our time. Be proud of that. Be excited. We can do awesome things together.
